# Programming Foundation

This repo contains notes and handouts I used to teach
introductory programming and software development.

## About the Course
### Prerequisites
The course starts from the basics but assumes basic familiarity
with fundamental concepts like conditionals, variables and loops.
Although these topics are covered, someone without zero prior
experience might find the pace too fast.
The chapters on web development assume some familiarity with HTML
and CSS.

### Languages used
The **Python** programming language is used for the majority of the course,
Python 3 to be precise.
On the web development chapters, **Javascript**, **HTML** and **CSS** are also used.
